# E-Services API Project

A microservices api implemented using Node.js and Express. The api is initially composed of a gateway (entry point), identity-service and an audit-log service.

There will additional services added in future development. RabbitMQ will allow for communication between microservices. Winston logger logs all necessary activity.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed.
2. Create necessary .env files. Note: a template of required environment variables will be made available.
3. In a terminal, run: `npm install`.

## Running the Project

## CI/CD

## Docker

## Documentation

Each microservice has `/docs/swagger` and `/docs/redoc` endpoints that provide documentation for all its api endpoints.
